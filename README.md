## 📦 Overview

This repository contains a **multi-language Logistics Management System** developed in **Java** and **C++**, submitted for the [CPS2004 Object Oriented Programming](https://www.um.edu.mt/courses/studyunit/CPS2004) unit at the University of Malta.

The system handles:
- Product management with 12+ specialised subclasses
- Transport services via Factory Pattern
- Shipment tracking using Decorator Pattern
- Portable persistence via Protocol Buffers
- gRPC-based distributed computation for remote stock valuation

Each section is modularised and includes both source code and build instructions.

## 🧠 Functional Highlights

### ✅ Q1 – Core Application (Java & C++)
- CLI app for managing Products, Transports, Shipments, Customers
- Product Hierarchy with 12+ subclasses (Books, Electronics, Clothing, etc.)
- Shipment calculations: total cost, delivery estimates
- C++ version mirrors Java structure with OOP principles

### 🏗️ Q2 – Design Patterns
- **Factory Pattern** for flexible creation of products and transport objects
- **Decorator Pattern** for runtime shipment enhancements:
  - Global discount decorator
  - Route adjustment decorator

### 📀 Q3 – Data Persistence
- Protocol Buffers to serialize/deserialize application state
- Save/load functionality with `convertToData()` and `convertFromData()`
- Java → Proto files and code generation
- **C++ Stock Viewer** using reused CLI logic

### 🌐 Q4 – Distributed Computing with gRPC
- Java gRPC server for remote calculation of `Stock` annual returns
- Client implemented in C++ as required by assignment
- gRPC protos, stub generation, and integration with the Portfolio class

## 🧪 Build Instructions

### 🧰 Java (Maven)
```bash
cd Q1_Java/
mvn clean install
# Run CLI.java main class
```

### 🛠️ C++ (CMake)
```bash
cd Q1_Cpp/
cmake .
make
./CLI
```

> Ensure C++20-compatible compiler and Maven 3+ are installed.
